# Computer-Design
To Design a working tool that would be able to convert a given algorithm or pseudocode into its corresponding C Code.  The tool will accept the statements of a pseudocode as an input and generate a C Code for that algorithm.  We will also print the Symbol Table of the Pseudo Code for visualization purpose.
